# About me

**Hi!** I'm ymstnt. *(Pronounced letter by letter in English:  /waɪ-ɛm-ɛs-tiː-ɛn-tiː/)*

🖥️ **I'm a Computer Science student**, and I've always been fascinated by computers. I started programming in elementary school, but over time, I became more interested in system administrator. I enjoy working with different operating systems - my favorite being **Linux**, and for the past couple of years, **NixOS** has been my preferred distribution.

💾 **A friend and I run a small server**, a Raspberry Pi 4B+, where we host our [website](https://tchfoo.com), various personal projects, and some useful services - all configured with Nix, of course. Lately, I've been experimenting as much as possible with the server: testing new tools, running services, and bringing my project ideas to life.
 
🎮 **In my free time, I enjoy gaming,** though I prefere a more relaxed experience over competetitive play. I'm especially drawn to **sandbox** games, particularly those in the **factory-building and tycoon** genre (**Factorio, Satisfactory, Shapez (2)**, Astroneer, Mindustry, etc.). A friend recently got me into **Deep Rock Galactic**, but I have other favorites as well: **Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Garry’s Mod, Terraria, Scrap Mechanic** - and I'm always open to trying new games.

🐟 **My interests go beyond computers.** I have a 60-liter aquarium filled with beautiful fish and plants. I enjoy hiking, rowing, and collecting rare coins, I also have a passion for writing. In addition, I love watching **shows** and **movies**, and I plan to share my thoughts on them in the future.

😶 **I have a fiery personality.** Sometimes, my wording may come across the wrong way, and I might unintentionally upset someone, - but it's never intentional. I'm working on being more mindful of this..

🌐 **This website is my personal space,** where I'll share my projects, posts, and reviews.[^1] The other site, [tchfoo.com](https://tchfoo.com), is a collaborative project with my friend, hosted on our own server. There, we showcase our joint work and services, whether public or private.

🔗 **The ymstnt.ovh domain is also mine**, and you'll find links to my social media profiles at the bottom of the page. Anything else you come aross is unrelated to me.[^2]

**I hope you enjoy your time here!** 🙂

[^1]: At first, I'll also share projects I've only 'contributed to', as I don't have many fully public projects yet. 

[^2]: That's the plan, at least - I still need to compile a list of all the platforms where I'm active. If a platform isn't mentioned, it's either because I don't use it, it's not mine, or I prefer to keep it private.
